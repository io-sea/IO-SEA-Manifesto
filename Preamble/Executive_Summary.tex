This document aims to be an annex to the last WP7 deliverable. It reminds the objectives and goals of the IO-SEA
project at the tile the project was submitted in late~2019 and early~2020. It then describes  the works 
done during the project and the related outcomes. From this perspective, this document then explains the topics that could be developed if someone wants to leverage the IO-SEA project for a later use in another project. 

\paragraph{}
In some ways, this "IO-SEA manifesto" is a "testament" too, it clearly defines what you can inherit fron IO-SEA
and the benefits you can get by using the provided results and outcomes.
