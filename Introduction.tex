The IO-SEA project is very close to its end at the time we write this document. This document is the "IO-SEA" 
manifesto, it aims to give all the keys to someone willing to leverage the outcomes of the IO-SEA project for
setting up a new project.

\paragraph{}
This approach is done via several steps. First, we will describe the original goals and ambitions of the project
as it was set up in late~2019 and early-2020. Since that time, the project was accomplished and it produced real
outcomes. 

The Devil is in the details and a few features, that have not been foreseen as the project was prepared, exists. 
They are peripheral and do not impact the run of the IO-SEA software stack that could easily work around it. 

On the other hand, some unexpected results arrived on the table, and they are actual benefits to be leveraged
and potentially reused in later projects. 

\paragraph{}
This document will gather all of this aspects, showing them in a short and synthetic manner. It is kind of 
"testament" or "manifesto", with the ambitions of giving the IO-SEA software stack keys to everyone willing
to use some elements from IO-SEA for other applications and projects.
